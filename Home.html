            My name is Ruari Green and I am a computer science student who is slated to graduate by the start of 2028, 
            and a developer of many awesome projects.  If you are here, then you are likely looking to learn a little 
            bit more about me and what I do.  
            <br/>
            Further down this page you will find previews and links to my Blog, Portfolio, and a Gallery of all my 
            favorite things and projects!  For a more personal look into my life, you can check out the About Me page, 
            where I tell you about myself.  
            <br/>
            If for any reason you want to inquire about anything on this website, you can go to the Contact Me page and 
            get a direct line to my email.  I will often get to your request within a few business days.
